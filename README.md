# IntegratedAIforUbuntu &  Gemini 2.0 Flash CLI Client


This project was born out of pure curiosity. It is designed to fetch and interact with the **Gemini 2.0 Flash** AI model via Google AI Studio.

The entire codebase was written using the **Pluma** text editor, and the logic is intentionally kept simple for ease of understanding.

`## Usage

You can run the application in the Ubuntu terminal by passing your question as an argument:

```bash
java AiApp "Your question here"
When asking questions with multiple words, please enclose your query in double quotes. Since command-line arguments are space-delimited, failing to use quotes (e.g., java AiApp Hello World) may result in only the first word being processed.
